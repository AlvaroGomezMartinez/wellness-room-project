### Summary
This project supports a wellness room check in/out procedure. An iPad is set up with the front office that students use to check in and out when they want to use the wellness room. Students will fill out a Google Form that asks for information such as their ID and reason for visit. When they check out they will be surveyed on how they are feeling.<br>
This Google Apps Script is bound to the Google Sheet that receives the responses from the from. The script will:<br>
1. calculate the duration of the visit.<br>
2. send an email to the counselor if a student needs additional support as indicated by their responses in the checkout survey.
#### Requirements
The script is triggered to run when a form is submitted.
